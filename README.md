## Description

Conda is an open source, language agnostic package and environment management system for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The conda ecosystem, including the conda-forge package repository, is widely used to install, run and update packages and their dependencies.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a full-fledged and easy to install Python software package using conda. We will start by introducing software packaging and packaging concepts (package dependencies, open source licensing, ...), and an introduction to the conda ecosystem and how conda implements software packaging.

Most of our time will be spent doing a hands-on walk through of how to prepare a Python software package for conda, and then how to submit that package to the conda-forge, a widely used community driven package repository.

The workshop is a hands-on workshop, where participants use their own laptops to prepare a full-fledged Python software package that is submission-ready for the conda-forge package repository. Participants need to bring a WiFi enabled laptop with a web browser, a command line interface, a text editor program, and git and/or a GitHub client already installed.

Workshop participants will gain a basic understanding of software packaging, and how to prepare and publish their packages in the conda ecosystem.
